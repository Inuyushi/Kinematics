Inuyushi's Gearswap Files

These files require the Motes libraries to run. The files are setup as sidecar files and required 
the main job files to run. I learned gearswap with the Mote files so that's just what I prefer. 
All of my gear and file customization is in the sidecar file. I have a lot of automation and
hpp/mpp time of day detection to determine which gear I should be wearing. I also auto-swap
to things when put to sleep to regain TP.

The "Main Job Files" lua should be in the following location: Windower4\addons\GearSwap\data

The "Side Car Files" lua should be in the following location: Windower4\addons\GearSwap\data\<player name>

Which for me is: Windower4\addons\GearSwap\data\Inuyushi

I'm constantly updating these and working out bugs. I'll do my best to keep them updated.

Contact me if you need any help figuring out the details behind my madness.
