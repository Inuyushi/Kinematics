Inuyushi's Gearswap Files

These files require the Motes libraries to run. The files are setup as sidecar files and required 
the main job files to run. I learned gearswap with the Mote files so that's just what I prefer. 
All of my gear and file customization is in the sidecar file. I have a lot of automation and
hpp/mpp time of day detection to determine which gear I should be wearing. I also auto-swap
to things when put to sleep to regain TP.

Contact me if you need any help figuring out the details behind my madness.
